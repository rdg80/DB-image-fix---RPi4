# DB-image-fix-RPi4

This is a tutorial on how to fix an old image that was put out back in 2021? And seemed to work fine back then, but was having issues loading now.  This might not work for everyone, but this is how I got it to work in my use case.  Hope this helps, enjoy!

Error:
start4.elf: is not compatible
